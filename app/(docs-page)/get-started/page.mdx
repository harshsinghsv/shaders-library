Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

Shaders UI is a collection of reusable components, each with a bunch of examples in different styles that can be used in various positions.
**I wondered how users would enjoy the journey of scrolling through a website if they didn't feel there was something special about it.**

##### Installation

<div className='space-y-6'>

**Step 1: Install the shaderz package**

```bash
npm install shaderz
```

**Step 2: Add a shader component using CLI**

```bash
npx shaderz add
```

This will prompt you to select a shader component. Once selected, the component will be automatically added to your `/components/shaderz` folder.

**Step 3: How to apply a shader on your website's hero section background?**

After adding the shader component, import and use it in your hero section:

```tsx app/page.tsx
import GradientWavesShader from '@/components/shaderz/GradientWavesShader';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <section className="relative min-h-screen">
      {/* Shader background */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 -z-10">
        <GradientWavesShader />
      </div>
      
      {/* Your hero content */}
      <div className="relative z-10 flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white">
          Welcome to Your Site
        </h1>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

</div>

##### Required Dependencies
